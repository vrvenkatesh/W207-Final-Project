First is cruising over mountains and oceans at blazing speeds in an F-16 while dodging missiles and releasing chaff packets. The second is a far more technical branch of simulators. These products take great pains to reproduce every last physical force on the aircraft bodies right down to vectored thrust and the effect of directional windspeed on flight times. While the first style is geared toward action lovers the second has far more appeal to would-be pilots and people who have actual licenses. Each of these styles also has its own representative series which defines its genre based on the crucial differences. Action has the venerable Jetfighter series while realists might prefer something along the lines of Combat Flight Sim 2 or Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000. Past realistic flight combat games have had one crucial historic element missing.80 - Adrenaline Vault',\n       'It can be a struggle but its all worth it when youre shooting fire out your antlers.KotakuThe world of The Deer God is incredibly hostile featuring so many dangerous animals it makes Far Cry 4 look like a petting zoo.PC GamerThe side-scrolling puzzle game takes elements of an endless runner and an RPG and mixes them into something very special.Polygon',\n       'This is one of those friendly games that just about anyone would enjoy picking up for short play sessions every now and again especially those who like their dungeon crawlers tinged with a sense of humor and a retro flavor.7 - GameSpot',\n       'JumpJet Rex does an admirable job of blending the best of old and new80 - DestructoidBeyond its nostalgic surface though is a game thats freaky fun and well-suited for pick-up-and-play gamers as much as it is for hardcore enthusiasts looking to set world records.88 - Digital ChumpsIf you are a fan of old school games like Mega Man this may be the easiest purchase you ever make.
